I am Stacker from United Kingdom, a solution-oriented Frontend developer with 7+ years of experience and a lifelong learner with a professional background in Information Technology and coding.
I enjoy development because of the satisfaction I get by overcoming challenges. I am motivated by the opportunity that software provides to positively impact the life of an individual, and the world as a whole.
